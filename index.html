          This project implements a 1D convolutional neural network in PyTorch, trained to classify ECG signals from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/shayanfazeli/heartbeat">MIT-BIH</a>
          dataset. The dataset consisted of over eighty-thousand samples assigned to 5 different categories of arrhythmia. It
          would be fair to say that the dataset was pretty considerably unbalanced, however, up sampling didn't seem to effect
          performance at all. The model architecture I used was two sets of convolutional, batch norm, max pooling, with dense
          layers used for classification. I produced learning curves to visualise both the change over time in training loss and
          accuracy, as well as validation loss and accuracy. I also produced a confusion matrix to display how well this model
          makes predictions. Overall the model fit the data very well, achieving 97.5% validation accuracy after only one epoch.
