        This project implements a 1D convolutional neural network in PyTorch, trained to classify ECG signals from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/shayanfazeli/heartbeat">MIT-BIH</a> dataset.
        The dataset consisted of over eighty-thousand samples assigned to 5 different categories of arrhythmia. It would be fair to say
        that the dataset was pretty considerably unbalanced, however, upsampling didn't seem to increase or decrease the efficacy of the 
        model. The model architechure I used was two sets of the standard convolutional, batch norm, max pooling, with a fully connected on the output.
        Click the graph to load a random signal from a fully balanced, hundred sample subset of the data I used for validation.
